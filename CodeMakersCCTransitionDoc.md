# Responsibilities
Your responsibilities will no doubt change from what mine where this year but I figured it was still worth telling you so you have an idea of what to expect.

### During the year
During the year you will expected to go to the office during work hours to create your curriculum tips for which can be found [here](#Project-Creation-Tips-and-Tricks). You'll be expected to come in to the alumni office around 5 hours a week to work on and complete your curriculum. From time to time you may be asked to come in on a weekend in order to help host a venture event. You will complete write ups of all your projects as well as submit purchase requests for items to run those projects. Finally you will participate in hiring next years staff.

### During the Summer
During the summer you will be expected to do final camp preparation as well as help other CCs with camp preparation. The majority of the first two summer months will be spent training the instructors. The final two months will be spent making sure your camps run smooth. In my case I was also tasked with taking tech from class to class. During the entire summer I suggest that you find something about venture that you can improve using software and do that when you have downtime during the workday, that way you are always doing something productive and meaningful.

As for moving technology around, organize the schedule in a way that allows you to make the least amount of trips possible and make sure that you have jc's help you/delegate moving it around to them at times.

# Project Creation Tips and Tricks

### Organizing for success
The biggest advice I can give you in this regard is to first write down what projects you want to run, don't figure out the logistics of the projects or anything just what it is you'd like to do. Then create a camp schedule for each camp using your yet to be done projects. Complete this within the first week to ensure you always have a goal to work towards.

### Coming up with ideas
Google is your best friend. Read the ontario curriculum for the grade you're trying to make a project for and get comfortable browsing through github and pintest for ideas. This process is hard to describe just like any creative endeavour but just keep it in the back of your mind and take your time.

### Using Projects from Previous Years
Do not be afraid to use projects from previous years. You can use codemakers 7/8 projects from codemakers 5/6, you can also use the RBG game write up that I created for you this year that I assume you never used.

### Write ups
Write ups will be the longest part of making your projects. Commenting your code makes this process much easier but regardless using and the template and good ole fashion time is how you'll get through these.

# Software installation
This is probably the biggest part of getting camp to run smoothly. Ensure that you and all the CCs are on the same page as to what software is getting installed where and what will happen each week -"at the end of each week 219a gets fully reset" for instance. Try to do this as early as possible, it may not be possible to do during the year but if you can find a way to do it during the year then by all means. 

## 219a
For now until they hire someone new your contact is [John Colenbrander](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mech/people/staff#john-colenbrander), he will work with you for 219a software or he will point you in the direction of the person who will help you. The thing is software can be downloaded on these computers, but most installations require the admin password. The loophole is that portable versions of software will run find. I highly recommend that you try to find portable editions of the software you need here.

## ETB 234
    
For ETB you don't have as much flexibility. Your contact is [Omar Danta](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/sept/people/staff#omar-danta). If you want any software installed speak with him.

## Everything Else
For 233a or any other lab with virtual machines you must contact UTS if you'd like to add software but they are highly hesitant to comply so I don't suggest you take that avenue. My recommendation is use these labs for browser based activities.

As for installing software on 30 computers at a time: Create a batch file like the one I created that will install everything at a time. Use a lot of USBs. Alternatively you can attempt to run a server sync and install but those are difficult to set up and will take more time than simply installing it using the usb batch file method. Moral of the story is it's up to you on how you want to handle batch installing software but the venture loader from last year will serve you as the best skeleton.

# Retrospective 
This is an optional read, I'm going to break down each project, what I thought went well, what went poorly and what could be improved.

## Codemakers 5/6
#### Edison Bots/Spheros + Ozo bots
I didn't like this project at all for 5/6. Spheros + ozo bots runs itself and the kids love them.

#### VND
I think VND was a great idea. I'm not sure what The Director will say about running it again (pitching it like they are always doing something different might help) but if you can do it because I think this is a great idea for teaching game design.

#### Python 101
This project was lackluster. Originally I had planned for all of 5/6 to be python so this was needed but they way it turned out that wasn't the best course of action. I'll touch on this later but I think 5/6 should be focused on webdev.

#### Python Choose Your Own Adventure
The original project was much too difficult and the second one was fine but a lot of copying.

#### Website
This project was fantastic, my only regret is that I didn't do more web development projects. I only learned webdev during the summer and then it was too late. I suggest you make more web based projects.

#### Minecraft Psi
I think you can copy the structure for this project but make sure the new instructors make the world and levels unique. This project seemed to be a success.

## Codemakers 7/8

#### Edison Bots
See [Edison Bots/Spheros + Ozo bots](#Edison-Bots/Spheros-+-Ozo-bots)

#### Andriod App Dev
This project is lackluster, probably better for 5/6 with a bit more refinement.

#### Java 101
See [Python 101](#Python-101)

### Minecraft Turtles
See [Minecraft](#minecraft-psi)

#### Arduino Pet
I loved this project. Only issue is that the campers don't do a lot of programming. If you could tweak this project to include more programming this project would be 10/10.

#### Digital Dissection
Staple project that runs itself and you can copy. I like it and it's simple.


# Mentors
For Codemakers 5/6 I contacted Dr. Anand at anandc@mcmaster.ca. 

For Codemakers 7/8 I contacted Nour (though he might not be there in your year) at mkrspace@mcmaster.ca.

Both of the mentors were amazing, discuss what you'd like to do with them and they will be a lot of help. But also don't be afraid to ask professors you like/know as they are your best resource for mentorship.

# Closing Remarks
You'll be getting a separate write up for managing the inventory system and if you ever have any questions you can reach me at gebrilg@mcmaster.ca or (905) 347-3388. I'll be around and available during the school year if you have any questions for me or need my help. 

You'll do a great job and I hope you have a ton of fun at the same time. You have the potential to really change a lot, if you can figure out a way to upload code/files fast easily and in a way that is accessible that would be huge for you and the future of venture. For me I made the inventory system, a file upload system could be your project. Learn a lot and don't be afraid to ask for help.
